**Overview:**
The RFID-Based Door Security System is an innovative solution designed to enhance access control in residential, commercial, and industrial settings. Leveraging Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, this system offers seamless and secure access management through RFID tags or cards assigned to authorized personnel.

**Key Features:**

1)**RFID Tag Identification:** Users are provided with RFID tags/cards that contain unique identification information.
2)**Secure Access Control:** The system grants access only to individuals with valid RFID tags/cards, ensuring unauthorized entry is prevented.
3)**Scalability:** Designed to be scalable, the system can accommodate varying numbers of users and access points as needed.

**Components:**

**1) RFID Reader(RC522 RFID Module):** This RC522 RFID Card Reader Module 13.56MHz is a low-cost MFRC522 based RFID Reader Module is easy to use and can be used in a wide range of applications.
**2) Arduino uno:** Processes data from RFID readers and controls access mechanisms. The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board based on the 
Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc. 
**3) RFID Card Or Key Fob Tag:** RFID Tag Keyfob used for sensing and identifying tagged people and objects for access control, automation, and a whole range of different applications.
**4) 9-12 V Power Supply:** Power supply is a reference to the source of electrical power. Most electronic circuits require a DC power supply. 
**5) Channel Relay Module:** The Single Channel Relay Module is a convenient board which can be used to control high voltage, high current load such as motor, solenoid valves, lamps and AC load.
**6) Selenoid lock:** The solenoid lock denotes a latch for electrical locking and unlocking. It is available in unlocking in the power-on mode type, and locking and keeping in the power-on mode type, which can be used selectively for situations.
**7) Jumper Wires:** A jumper wire is an electric wire that connects remote electric circuits used for printed circuit boards. By attaching a jumper wire on the circuit, it can be short-circuited and short-cut (jump) to the electric circuit. 


**Applications:**

**Residential Security:** Enhances home security by restricting access to authorized individuals.
**Commercial Buildings:** Controls access to offices, conference rooms, and restricted areas.
**Industrial Facilities:** Ensures only trained personnel enter hazardous or sensitive zones.


**Benefits:**

**Improved Security:** Minimizes security risks associated with traditional key-based systems.
**Convenience:** Eliminates the need for physical keys and reduces administrative overhead.
**Audit Trail:** Provides a detailed log of access activities for accountability and compliance purposes.


**Conclusion:**

The RFID-Based Door Security System offers a robust solution for modern access control needs, comprehensive security measures. Whether deployed in homes, offices, or industrial settings, this system ensures reliable and efficient access management, contributing to a safer and more secure environment.
